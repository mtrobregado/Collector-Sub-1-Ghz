  Project Description:
  - AWS IOT EduKit, collect sensor data via UART from a Texas Instruments Sub 1-Ghz sensor network, 
    and send these data to AWS IOT. Sub 1-Ghz sensor network consist of collector and sensor nodes. 
    Each sensor node is attached to a vaccine carrier cold box.
  
  Hardware:
  - AWS IOT EduKit
  - CC1352R Launchpad (collector)
  - LPSTK-CC1352R (sensor node connected to vaccine carrier cold box)  
  
  Programming Guide
  - Install SimpleLinkâ„¢ CC13xx and CC26xx software development kit (SDK) version 5.10.
  - Import CCS Project to TI Code Composer Studio v10.3 workspace.
  - Rebuild All. HEX file generated can be found at \Release folder
  - Program hex file using TI SmartRF FLash Programmer v1.8.0.
  - Red led will blink upon power on.
  - Green led will blink if a sensor node is connected.
